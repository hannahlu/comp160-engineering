#### Evidence-Based Practice for Desgining Accessible Games: How Can Mainstream Games Accomodate for the Visually Impaired?

##### Introduction:

Developing games to meet the many varying cognitive, physical, and visual needs of the population is a complicated and often expensive task. Whilst office computer and web applications, have been adapted successfully for the visually impaired, accessibility in the gaming industry is comparatively poor.   The reliance of mainstream games on impressive visuals makes adpatation for the visually impaired far more complex than other applications.  However, several creative technologies and strategies have been designed to improve games for the visually impaired, using music \cite{Lotto}, specially designed gaming devices \cite{Ohtsuka}, and using conversion of images into sounds \cite{Marshall}. Within software engineering, developers often face tight deadlines which may prevent  accessibility from being priotorized in the engineering of games \cite{softwaredevelopers}. This paper aims to explore existing games designed specifically for the visually impaired and how mainstream games can learn from these examples, obstacles that software developers face in constructing accessible games and how academia can help prepare students to assist in improving accessibility.
