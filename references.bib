abstract={Musical games help in motor and cognitive development and provide pleasure because of their playfulness and challenge. However, visually impaired people are unable to interact with conventional music games, because audiovisual aspects are inaccessible to this public. The objective of this study was to investigate if three-dimensional sounds could guide blind users during interaction with a tablet music game. As a proof of concept, a musical game for Android was developed with binaural audio techniques. Three fully blind users evaluated the game. The results show that the developed game was able to immerse the users in a virtual environment.},

abstract={During the last five years, we have been developing the Body-Braille system which uses 6 vibration motors corresponding to the units of Braille. Disabled people can wear this system and sense Braille characters by vibration patterns on any part of the body. We have performed several experiments in which disabled people could get needed support for daily life through Body-Braille. Since we are developing a new type of equipment, we chose to make one of its main applications a game. Our new equipment is so small that it is very easy to carry it anywhere, such as on a train. Disabled people can play a game using the equipment while traveling around. The software of the game application employs a table based structure so that anyone can create a new game application with very little programming work. As a result, we have successfully developed the software for game creation.},

Based on user feedback regarding the effectiveness of the methods employed in AudioQuake, techniques for not only im-parting but allowing vision-impaired users to edit 3D structures are proposed. Taking into account the progress made so far, we make the case for future research work, which could benefit many differ-ent types of users and help increase accessibility in other areas such as education.},

pages={316-317}, 
abstract={We have developed a vibration watch on a mobile phone for visually impaired people. This watch has some merits: It operates on a mobile phone which many people are always carrying. It does not have to adjust the time because it uses the time function of the mobile phone which is adjusted automatically. In this paper, first we decided the characteristic of the vibration watch. Next we did a experiment which recognizes the number of times of vibration in order to show the time. We found it was difficult for subjects to recognize five vibration or more. Using a long vibration which means 5 times, we were able to shorten the oscillating interval which can recognize the number of times of vibration. Finaly we constituted the vibration watch on a mobile phone and we had confirmed that the watch function operated.},

Until now, evaluating AVSS solutions required the creation of a sensory substitution device (SSD) to test a strategy for converting images into sounds. This process often takes years to complete. 3D game engines provide a research and training platform that is capable of quickly implementing and testing different image-to-sound conversion strategies in a virtual world environment.},

abstract = {In developing software systems, software engineers use software development life cycles such as the waterfall, prototyping or spiral model. Whilst these life cycles ensure that the system meets the needs of people without disabilities, the needs of people with disabilities are often overlooked thus resulting in systems that are inaccessible and unusable to them. In this paper, we propose a disability-aware software engineering process model which considers the needs of people with disabilities, hence improving accessibility and usability of the designed system. These needs are captured through the accessibility, usability and functional requirements of the system in the requirements analysis phase of the life cycle model.},
