## Evidence-Based Practice for Designing Accessible Games: How Can Mainstream Games Accommodate for the Visually Impaired?

### Introduction:
Developing games to meet the many varying cognitive, physical, and visual needs of the population is a complicated and often expensive task. Whilst other software, such as office computer and web applications, have been adapted successfully for the visually impaired, accessibility in the gaming industry is comparatively poor. The reliance of mainstream games on impressive visuals makes adaptation for the visually impaired far more complex than other applications. 

However, several creative technologies and strategies have been designed to improve games for the visually impaired, using music to signify transitions \cite{Lotto}, echoes to describe 3D spaces \cite{5}, specially designed gaming devices \cite{Ohtsuka}, and the conversion of images into sounds \cite{Marshall}. 

Within software engineering, developers often face tight deadlines which may prevent accessibility from being prioritized in the engineering of games \cite{3} \cite{Issues in student valuing of software engineering best practices}. This paper aims to explore how mainstream games can learn from software designed specifically for the visually impaired and to highlight obstacles facing the development of accessible games.

### Case Studies
* AudioQuake:
Quake [4] is one of the first FPS mainstream games to be adapted to suit the visually impaired, in the form of AudioQuake, which uses an auditory interface [5]. The creators were keen to not only enable basic game play, but ensure blind users could participate online and in the building of their own level maps.
Adapting Quake into an accessible game for the visually impaired involved several stages of development, beginning with the low-level requirements necessary to implement an auditory interface. Audio needed to be improved to create more realistic cues for the visually impaired, such as indicating room size using echoes.
AudioQuake is part of the AGRIP project [6] which aim for games, to not only playable by the disabled, but that enables them to play evenly matched with or against able-bodied players, create their own map levels and adjust game settings. AudioQuake was built with LDL (Level Description Language), an XML programming language designed specifically to enable developers to describe 3D spaces and for visually impaired players to be able to create 3D levels.
A vital part of the AGRIP Project is community contribution, and particularly disabled-user’s feedback. During development, AudioQuake was regularly play-tested at conventions, such as Sight Village [] and conversations between users on the mailing list were encouraged for greater insight into the games effectiveness.

### Application of Accessibility in Mainstream Games
In the 1980s computer software applications first started to be adapted for the disabled. Nowadays most web and office software is accessible for the visually impaired, however, mainstream video games are overwhelming inaccessible [].

### Obstacles	
1.	Time pressures in gaming industry
2.	Application of accessibility during the development of games, and not only an afterthought
3.	Teaching of accessible game engineering best practices in higher-education
4.	The high visual reliance of mainstream games
5.	Awareness and research of the benefits of gaming for the visually impaired
6.	Developing techniques to implement evenly-matched games between able and non-able bodied players
### Recommendations
1.	Further Research 
2.	Prioritization
3.	Improving time pressures and training for software developers 
4.	More capabilities of Languages such as LDL
5.	Visually-Impaired User Feedback
6.	Not just basic playable, enable evenly-matched play against able-bodied users and the ability to adjust map levels, game settings, personalized characters (through use of audio/voice rather than appearance)
7.	Games must still be games when adapted. Not just usable, but enjoyable
8.	Make use of available software development tools, such as LDL, and research performed for visually impaired games
9.	Introduce and implement an industry standard of guidelines for accessible gaming for the visually impaired.
