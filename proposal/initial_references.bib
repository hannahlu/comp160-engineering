abstract={Video games are becoming less and less usable by people with disabilities every day. These disabilities include cognitive, visual, and mobility. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the necessity of making video games accessible. This will be done through looking at benefits, current work for all disabilities, and how it's looked at by the law. The topic of video gaming accessibility is especially important in today's age with the disabled population rising. It is important to not let the disabled be left out of the enjoyment of video games.},

abstract={Web accessibility/mobile app accessibility for the disabled has been studied for the past 10 years. The legislation of web accessibility guidelines can guarantee easy access to web contents of the disabled but not game playing, because web/ mobile app contents consists of rather simple information compared with game contents. Game contents include many PCs (player characters)/NPCs (non PCs) and the conflicts among them, as well as upgrade of a player character by completion of a quest in competition. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and classify game accessibility so as to make the game accessibility guidelines.},

Moreover, unfortunately, it is still difficult for visually impaired persons to play the same game with sighted persons and for sighted and visually impaired persons to share a common subject. Thus, we developed a barrier-free game that both sighted and visually impaired persons can play using their dominant senses including visual, auditory and tactile senses.},

It then proposes a means for studying student valuing of these `best practice' skill areas.},

We evaluated our game in an in-the-wild study. The results show that our setup is able to provide a mutually fun game experience while maintaining a fair winning chance for both players. Based on our study, we also suggest guidelines for future developments of games for visually impaired people that could help to further include blind people into society.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the result of an experiment, in which we compare the gaming experience between sighted players and visually impaired players playing the same game. Specifically we discuss whether they experience the same story construed from the plot elements that are either manifested by audio and graphics in the case of sighted players or primarily by audio in the case of visually impaired players. To this end, we have developed a graphical point-and-click adventure game for iOS and Android devices. The game has been designed to provide players with audio feedback that enables visually impaired players to interact with and experience the game, but in a manner that does not interfere with the overall appearance and functionality of the game, i.e. a design that is fully inclusive to both groups of players and that is as invisible for sighted players as possible without hindering visually impaired players to share the same gaming experience when it comes to story content. The study shows that the perception of the story was almost identical between the two groups. Generally it took visually impaired players a little longer to play the game but they also seem to listen more carefully to the dialogue and hence also build a slightly deeper understanding of the characters.},

Until now, evaluating AVSS solutions required the creation of a sensory substitution device (SSD) to test a strategy for converting images into sounds. This process often takes years to complete. 3D game engines provide a research and training platform that is capable of quickly implementing and testing different image-to-sound conversion strategies in a virtual world environment.},

abstract={Musical games help in motor and cognitive development and provide pleasure because of their playfulness and challenge. However, visually impaired people are unable to interact with conventional music games, because audiovisual aspects are inaccessible to this public. The objective of this study was to investigate if three-dimensional sounds could guide blind users during interaction with a tablet music game. As a proof of concept, a musical game for Android was developed with binaural audio techniques. Three fully blind users evaluated the game. The results show that the developed game was able to immerse the users in a virtual environment.},

abstract={During the last five years, we have been developing the Body-Braille system which uses 6 vibration motors corresponding to the units of Braille. Disabled people can wear this system and sense Braille characters by vibration patterns on any part of the body. We have performed several experiments in which disabled people could get needed support for daily life through Body-Braille. Since we are developing a new type of equipment, we chose to make one of its main applications a game. Our new equipment is so small that it is very easy to carry it anywhere, such as on a train. Disabled people can play a game using the equipment while traveling around. The software of the game application employs a table based structure so that anyone can create a new game application with very little programming work. As a result, we have successfully developed the software for game creation.},
